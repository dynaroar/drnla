# Instrument script in Bash and Python
The configuration run is 10 random inputs between (-100, 100).

- `compi.sh`, replace all nondet definitions, adding input argument for the main, results in `output` direction.
- `compi.py`, calculating the input argument number, and replace in nondet assignment, then compile the c into executables.
- `random_run.py`, generated different number of random input for binaries, run the bianries, and calculate average Wall time, output them into a latex table.
